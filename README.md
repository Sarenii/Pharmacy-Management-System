Title: Pharmacy Management System (PMS)

Problem: Traditional paper-based systems for managing pharmacy sales and inventory can be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to track. This can lead to lost sales and decreased customer satisfaction. The Pharmacy Management System (PMS) was developed to streamline the process and improve efficiency.

Goal: To create a user-friendly and efficient pharmacy management system that allows admin users to manage sales and inventory, and salesman users to process sales.

Approach:

User Research: Conducted user research to identify the common pain points and needs of pharmacy sales and inventory management. This included interviews with pharmacists and salespeople to gain a deep understanding of their workflows.

Wireframes and Prototyping: Developed wireframes and prototypes based on the research insights. We created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes to test the user flow and gather feedback from users.

Iterative Design: Used an iterative design process to refine and improve the design based on user feedback. We incorporated features such as easy product search and filter options, simple checkout processes, and customizable user roles for admin and salesman users.

Design Decisions:

Stack: We used node.js, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, ejs as the template engine, and Express as the node.js framework to develop the PMS.

User Roles: We created two user roles - admin and salesman - to ensure that each user has access only to the features they need.

Product Management: Admin users can add products based on category, batch no, and generic name, and can edit them if necessary.

Sales Management: Salesman users can process sales, and admin users can view and manage sales data.

User Interface: We designed the user interface to be clean and simple, with easy-to-understand features and a logical flow. This makes it easy for users to navigate the system and complete tasks quickly.

Results: The Pharmacy Management System (PMS) has been successfully implemented and has improved the efficiency of pharmacy sales and inventory management. Customers are now served more quickly, with fewer errors and lost sales, leading to increased customer satisfaction.

Conclusion: The Pharmacy Management System (PMS) is a successful example of how technology can streamline and improve traditional workflows. By understanding user needs and designing a user-friendly interface, we were able to create a system that is easy to use and has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of pharmacy management.
